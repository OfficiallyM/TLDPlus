# TLDPlus

## A collection of small tweaks to improve the overall game experience

Features:
- Uses a modular system with each module able to be turned on or off on the fly, and have their available settings changed
- Custom settings UI available from the default mod settings (M key mod list > Find TLDPlus > Settings)

### Available modules:
- Better tank caps
  - Makes tank caps show fluids with a percentage lower than 1%, vanilla game hides those normally
  - Shows capacity and percentage to two decimal places allowing for more controlled pouring
- Hold to shit
  - Tired of spamming B to have a shit? Now you can hold it instead
- Better tumbleweeds
  - Limits the amount of tumbleweeds which can spawn to a configurable amount (defaults to 20)
